# ImprovisedTDS

A simple Top-Down Shooter game written in C++ using GLFW and OpenGL. As it mentioned in the repo's name, this game is totally improvised and does not have a plan on its development.

## TODO

- [x] Add existing sources
- [ ] Make all libraries to be in the repo as submodules and change C++ directories path
  - [ ] GLFW
  - [ ] zlib
  - [ ] lpng
  - [ ] glew
  - [ ] glm
- [ ] Reorder source files to be in `src` directory instead of directory with the VS project file, do the same with the headers
- [ ] Convert Visual Studio project to CMake
- [ ] Make the project to be working
- [ ] Use stb_image library for reading and writing image assets instead of lpng
